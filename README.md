# Speech-To-Text--SRT-
A Python-based speech-to-text system that uses microphone input and Google Web Speech API, designed with noise robustness and retry logic to ensure accurate transcription even in noisy environments.

#🎙️ Noise-Robust Speech-to-Text System

This is a simple and fast **Speech Recognition (Speech-to-Text)** Python project using the `speech_recognition` library. It is designed to be **noise-robust** and user-friendly, with support for retrying if speech is not understood.

## 🚀 Features

* 🎧 Real-time speech recognition using your microphone
* 🔇 Automatically adjusts for background noise
* 🔁 Repeats listening until clear speech is detected
* 🤖 Uses Google Web Speech API for transcription

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyaudio
```

> **Note**: On some systems, you may need to install additional drivers or packages to enable microphone access (e.g., `portaudio`).

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Microphone calibrates for ambient noise.
2. Prompts the user to speak after a short delay.
3. If the speech is unclear or not recognized, the program asks the user to "Speak again".
4. Continues until a valid transcription is obtained.

## 📄 Example Output

```
Please be quiet. Calibrating microphone for background noise (3 seconds)...
Minimum energy threshold set to: 400
Start speaking after the beep...
Beep! 🎤
Processing your speech...
You said: hello world
```

## 📁 File Structure

## 📌 Notes

* Internet connection is required since the transcription uses Google’s Web Speech API.
* Performance may vary based on microphone quality and ambient noise level.
